#overview
This python code implements a quantum filter that takes in an analog input from the mic/line in, encodes it into a set of Ry rotations and outputs the result of the measurements to the audio out.

it leverages pyaudio for input/output and PyQT5 for its UI. Most of the heavy lifting is done using numpy.
